# ec01-wp-core
The directory framework for the WordPress core to match the rest of the EC01 setup. Does not include the core files themselves.
This is designed to work with EC01-HTML. That respository contains the `index.php` file that pulls in the configuration files and related constants. This is included to ensure the WordPress core is set up in the expected directory with a naming schema that matches the rest of the project.
